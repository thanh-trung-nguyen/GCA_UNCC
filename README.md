# GCA_UNCC
This is the C++ code for the globally convergent method for coefficient identification problem for the wave equation. 
This code is based partly on the WaveES package developed by Larisa Beilina.

The golbally convergent algorithm has been developed by Michael Klibanov, Larisa Beilina, Thanh Nguyen and some other collaborators.
