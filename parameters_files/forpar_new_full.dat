=========== explain the input parameters: ===============
1. could be 2 or 3.

2. .inp file containing the FDM, FEM grids. This files must be created before running the forward solver. In this test, they are actually the same!

3. Boundary grid file name

4. FDM_domain: 16 51 17: the number of FDM grid points in x, y, z. The parameters 0.04 0.04 0.04: the grid sizes. -0.5 -1.08 -0.32: the coordinates of the minimum point in the FDM domain.

5. FEM domain: similar to the FDM parameters. Note that the FEM domain MUST be contained in the FDM domain.

6. USE_FDM_FEM_Exchange: the logical code. If = 1, the we use the hybrid FDM FEM method. Otherwise, set it to 0.

7. USE_FEM: = 1 if we use only FEM method. 

8. Similar as USE_FEM but for using the FDM

9. USE_RHS: = 1 if the right hand side (source term) is present. In this case, we have to choose a right_hand_side_code value which corresponds to a given right hand side function implemented in the software.

10. USE_DIR_FEM: = 1 if we use the Dirichlet boundary condition for the FEM method. If USE_FDM_FEM_Exchange = 1, then set it to be 0.

11. USE_DIR_FDM: similar to USE_DIR_FEM

12. USE_ABSORB: = 1 if the absorbing boundary condition is used. 

13. PRINT_FILES: = 1 if you want to save the solution of the forward problem.

14. number of time steps

15. maximum time instant

16. Right_Hand_Side_Code: the code for choosing different right hand side functions, this is given in the function WavesFuncDefs.C. You can define your own functions in this C code file.

17. Type of boundary condition: depends on the type of incident wave. For plane waves, we choose among different directions which is given by 
planewave_x_max (on the X-max boundary), planewave_x_min (on the X-max boundary), and similar for y and z-directions.

18. Noise level to be added to the simulated data

19. Frequency of the incident plane wave applied on the boundary, see 17.

20: for saving the simulation on the FDM domain

21. File names for 20.

22. number of inclusions (subdomains) in the FEM domain which has different material types from the rest of the FEM domain. 

from 23 - 26:

23. Type of object, a string can ONLY be choosen among: sphere, cylinder, prism, polyhedral (not implemented yet!)

24. Type_of_material: codes for different materials of the object in the FEM domain. NOTE:  type of material for element is type of material in *.inp file -1

25. Coefficient value of the corresponding object

26. Coord_of_Subdomain: coordinate of the objects in the FEM. For different types of object, provide different sets of parameters: 
	- sphere: CenterX CenterY CenterZ Radius NaN NaN
	- prism: Xmin Xmax Ymin Ymax Zmin Zmax 
	- cylinder_x: CenterY CenterZ RadiusYZ Xmin Xmax NaN
	- cylinder_y: CenterX CenterZ RadiusXZ Ymin Ymax NaN
	- cylinder_z: CenterX CenterY RadiusXY Zmin Zmax NaN

Similar for 27-42. Note: provide similar parameter sets for each object. 
REMARK: - if many objects overlaps, the big ones must be declared before the small ones. Object type MUST BE in lower case letters. 
	- For the coordinate rows, if the number of parameters needed for an object is less than 6, just left the rest to be -9999 or any other number. The necessary parameters must be provided from left to right as in the above order.
